# README

## Twitter Clone for BURGER KING; When making a rails app.
	added bootstrap 3 gem, and sass and improved UI.


	Known bugs : ~~"Currently the submit button only works once. and then crashes"~~
				This was caused because you can't put a form inside a table, so I removed my Table classes

				Also fixed my button errors by forcing white on all btn classses with !important

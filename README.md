## Twitter Clone for BURGER KING; When making a rails app.
	added bootstrap 3 gem, and sass and improved UI.


##Achievements
* Tweet Stream page updated
* Logo and Navbar repositioned
* Votes Gem implemented you can find that [here](https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable)
* Added admin page
* fixed spelling errors tweets vs sizzles
* linked tweets to users
* add some BK ads on the homepage
* Fixed button errors by forcing white on all btn classes with !important


##Challenges
* Legacy code
* still mentions tweets throughout the page in Admin page
* Trying to get profile URL to = "/:user"  so each user has their own URL..For now it's just "/profile
* Currently the submit button only works once. and then crashes - This was caused because you can't put a form inside a table, so I removed my Table classes.

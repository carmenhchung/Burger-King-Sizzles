				* Fixed button errors by forcing white on all btn classes with !important


				##Challenges
				* Legacy code
				* still mentions tweets throughout the page in Admin page
				* Trying to get profile URL to = "/:user"  so each user has their own URL..For now it's just "/profile
				* Currently the submit button only works once. and then crashes - This was caused because you can't put a form inside a table, so I removed my Table classes.

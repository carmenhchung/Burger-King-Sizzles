### Giant Peach Corporation first Challenge; Burger King Inspired Twitter Clone. ( 'Burger King Sizzles')

#James' Summary
Personal Challenges as Team Leader  -
	Being thrown into team lead for the first time, was super confronting; Managing a huge team of 12 people all of us super unsure about best GIT practice, and most of us struggling with imposter syndrome.

	Some things I realized I should have done very early, was keep more concrete notes; we did our ERB and user stories on a white board, and I had the team record them, but I didn't keep a personal copy, which I could easily refer back to .

	Additionally another constant problem was we didn't specify basic conventions like everyone use their own stylesheet, for the front end, which would have made comparing which parts are effected quite a lot easier.

	As time was a factor I feel our biggest mistake and one that I was pushing for originally was using legacy codebase, which of course just adds problems on top of problems, and additionally having very different skill levels amoung the team, and lots of confusion about GIT, definitely influenced our morale.

##### Achievements
		I'm super proud of how the team came together, we all met up on the weekend and really put the work in to get the project finished on time.  They also made it extremely easy to be their team lead, with all of them listening and taking on the work.

		One personal achievement was to use GIT with 13 branches, and try to get the team to make asynchronous changes; while I still think we have a while to go before we are super comfortable with it completely.

###### Things I learned:
	Team work can be super fun, and rewarding and also the worst.

	We utilized some new gems, this time around which was really good, but it also pushed me to realised I'm still such a novice when it comes to ROR and it will be an exciting journey to learn more.

# Burger King Brand Twitter Clone: Burger King Sizzles
## Presented by Giant Peach Corporation

# TASK

Our team (Giant Peach Corporation) was tasked to create a Burger King branded Twitter clone within five days using Ruby on Rails, with the following requirements:

* Provide young people with a twitter-like application.
* Designed within Burger King Co brand style guides.
* Keep within a G rating.
* Supply Burger King Co inspired tweet naming convention.

# SYNOPSIS

Our Technical & Cost Proposal can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4E-nX-9D2HIa2w4R0dJc0kweVE). 

## Users

The application is designed to allow users to:

* Sign up and login/logout (with user authentication).
* Create, edit and delete tweets (known as "sizzles" in the application), including photographs.
* Like (known as "whop" in the application) and unlike (known as "dewhop") sizzles.
* Reply to other users' sizzles.

## Client

The application is designed to allow the client to:

* Login to an admin account.
* View an admin dashboard panel with the latest tweets and statistics about the users, including the users who are most active on the platform.

# ACHIEVEMENTS

* Created wireframes / design mockups.

# CHALLENGES & LESSONS LEARNT

* Adapting legacy code.
* Ensuring that the front end, UI/UX, and back end teams had the same, consistent vision for the project.
* Modifications to admin dashboard panel obtained through gem (trying to change "tweets" to "sizzles" etc) and restricting access to the admin panel (currently users can login to the admin panel if they find the /admin url).
* Trying to get profile URL to = "/:user"  so each user has their own URL, rather than just "/profile".
* At one stage, the submit button only worked once before crashing (solution: you cannot put a form inside a table, so the table classes was removed).
* Issues encountered by individuals with respect to postgresql and with bcrypt gem (with solutions only working after a significant investment of time, and not consistently).
* Lack of knowledge of Ruby on Rails.
* Understanding what was involved with some of the roles (such as Digital Producer) and grappling with lack of experience in them (such as Account Director).
* Tight timeframe given the public holiday.
* Difficulties also encountered with simultaneous processes occurring at once (such as front end, UX/UI, and back end happening at the same time).
* Use of Git, including using, pulling and merging branches. The following lessons were learnt for Git:
## Simple merges
Simple merges can be done through the GitHub site. For example, when updating the README.md file follow these steps:
1.    Create pull request.
    2.    Create merge.
    3.    Check conflicts.
    4.    Resolve conflicts by removing >>>>>>>> & ======= & <<<<<<< .
    5.    Commit changes.

## Command Line Merges
For complicated merges, use the command line. 
    !!WARNING!! Make sure you know what the changes are before making changes, this may mean talking to the person who made them!
1.    Create pull request.
2.    Create merge.
3.    Open terminal.
4.    Move to Master Branch
```
    "git checkout master"
    "git fetch origin"
    "git checkout -b <branch name>"
    "git merge master"
```
5.    If conflicts appear, open atom and navigate to said conflicts.
6.    Add or delete conflicts using the Atom buttons*
    !!! *however if changes are not what is required make changes manually and delete >>>>>>>> & ======= & <<<<<<<  marks
7.    After changes have resolved. 
```
    "git add ."
    "git commit -m "<message>""
    "git merge master"
```
8.    Now your master and branch are merged on your local computer
```
    "git checkout master"
    "git merge â€”no-ff <branch>"
    "git push origin master"
```
9.    Now your master and branch are merged on Github.
